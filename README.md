SENG 474 – Data Mining Assignments

This repo contains my three assignments from SENG 474: Data Mining at the University of Victoria. Each assignment is in its own folder with a detailed README explaining how to run the code and what’s inside.

The assignments cover a range of machine learning methods and topics from the course, including:

Classification & Ensembles (Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, k-fold cross-validation)

Support Vector Machines & Neural Networks (on the Fashion MNIST dataset, with hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation)

Clustering & Unsupervised Learning (k-means, k-means++, hierarchical clustering, initialization methods, convergence analysis)

The focus throughout is on both implementing models and analyzing their performance, with experiments, visualizations, and comparisons between different approaches.
