This folder contains all of the neccesary code to obtain the results that I presented in my report.

To run any of the following files, ensure that you have both datasets (dataset1 and dataset2) in the same directory as that of the code files are in.
This folder contains five ipynb files. The files and a short description of the work they contain is as follows:

uniform_random_initilization.ipynb: Contains all scripts to perform uniform random uniform random initilization on both datasets and plot the results, as well as any further experiments such as averaging the number of iterations it takes for amodel to covnerge.

k_means++.ipynb: Follows the same structure of uniform_random_initilization.ipynb, run the algorithm to build the clusters, and plot the data. This file works with both datasets.

HAC.ipynb: Follows the same structure as uniform_random_initilization.ipynb, run the algorithm to build the clusters, and plot the data. This file works with both datasets for both single and average linkage.

The following resources were used to help write components of code:

As well as further scikit learn documentation
